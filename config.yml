It's a round perfect for those wishing to learn a job role peacefully. Of course, we cannot guarantee you will not be collateral!"
    - caption: "Donor Chat"

    - caption: "Purrbation"
      details: "You have the option to spawn with purrbation enabled, which gives you cat ears and a tail. Why you would want this? Well, who knows, but we threw it in anyway."
    - caption: "New HUDs"
      details: "You get to select a fancy new HUD. That's pretty cool I guess..."
